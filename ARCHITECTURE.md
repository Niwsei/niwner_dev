# System Architecture & Team Work Distribution

## Architecture Overview
- **API Gateway** handles load balancing, rate limiting, and routes requests to services.
- **Frontend Layer** consists of separate micro-apps:
  - Web App (Next.js)
  - Mobile App (React Native)
  - Admin Dashboard (React + Charts)
- **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** orchestrates GraphQL/REST APIs for frontend clients.
- **Message Bus** uses Apache Kafka for event-driven communication.
- **Microservices Layer** includes domain services such as User, Course, Payment, Logic Training, Project Management, Flow Design, Video, Search, Notification, Analytics, AI/ML, Email, File Storage, Security, and Audit.
- **Data Layer** employs multiple data stores:
  - PostgreSQL for transactional data
  - MongoDB for documents
  - Redis for cache & sessions
  - Elasticsearch for search
  - InfluxDB for metrics
  - MinIO for object storage

## Frontend Micro-Apps
- **Landing App:** marketing pages rendered with Next.js and served via CDN.
- **Course App:** React SPA managing catalog, course player, progress, and assessments.
- **Interactive Tools App:** React components for logic puzzles, flow design canvas, and project boards with real-time collaboration.
- **User Portal:** dashboard for profiles, subscriptions, and settings.
- **Community App:** forums, chat, video calls, and study groups using WebRTC.
- **Mobile App:** React Native delivering course streaming, offline mode, and push notifications.
- **Admin Dashboard:** React + charting libraries for business intelligence, content management, and system monitoring.

## Backend Services (Domain Driven Design)
- **Identity & Access Management:** authentication, authorization, profile, and sessions.
- **Learning Management System:** course, content delivery, progress tracking, assessments, and certificates.
- **Payment & Billing:** gateway integrations, subscriptions, invoices, revenue tracking, and refunds.
- **Intelligent Learning:** logic training, recommendation engine, skill assessments, and adaptive learning.
- **Workflow & Project Services:** flow design, project management, team collaboration, tasks, and resource planning.
- **Analytics & Reporting:** learning analytics, business intelligence, monitoring, and reports.
- **Communication Services:** messaging, email, notifications, video conferencing, and forums.
- **Platform Services:** file storage, search, security, audit logging, and configuration.

## Team Structure
- **Team Alpha – User Experience & Authentication (4 members):** frontend lead, React developer, backend identity developer, and mobile developer.
- **Team Beta – Learning Management System (5 members):** frontend lead, two React developers, and two backend developers for courses and assessments.
- **Team Gamma – Interactive Tools & AI (4 members):** frontend lead, React interactive developer, AI/ML developer, and backend developer for logic & flow.
- **Team Delta – Community & Communication (3 members):** full-stack community lead, React social developer, and backend communication developer.
- **Team Echo – Payment & Business Logic (3 members):** backend payment lead, full-stack analytics developer, and backend business logic developer.
- **Platform Team – Infrastructure (4 members):** DevOps lead, database architect, security engineer, and QA engineer.

## Development Phases
1. **Foundation (Months 1-4):** infrastructure setup, authentication, basic course features, and payment integration.
2. **Advanced Features (Months 5-7):** interactive tools, community elements, enhanced LMS, and mobile app features.
3. **Scale & Polish (Months 8-10):** advanced analytics, AI personalization, security hardening, and launch preparation.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React Query/Zustand, React Native, Jest, Vite.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes.
- **Infrastructure:** AWS/GCP, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Kong API Gateway, Vault.

## Communication & Standards
- Daily standups, bi-weekly all-hands, two-week sprints, and architecture reviews.
- Documentation uses ADRs, OpenAPI specs, testing docs, deployment guides, and performance benchmarks.
- Code standards include thorough reviews, >80% test coverage, security scanning, accessibility guidelines, and internationalization readiness.
